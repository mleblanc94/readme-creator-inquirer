# ReadMe Creator Inquirer
A command line application that allows a user to generate a README after answering some prompted questions.

## Description

- I was motivated to create this README Generator to make it much easier for users to create their READMEs.
- I created this project to work on my Node JS skills, particularly when it comes to using the Inquirer NPM package and learning the proper syntax to create an application using it.
- By creating this application, I solved the problem of always needing to do the boring work of creating READMEs that are very similar with very similar sections.
- Through doing this activity, I learned more about using javascript in Node JS and using a package in order to build out a command line application that can actually be useful for generating needed files


## Installation

- In order to use this application, the user will need to have access to the command line.
- Once they are in the command line, they will need to cd into the readme-creator-inquirer/Develop folder.
- Once in the folder, the user will have to run node index.js in the command line.
- From there, the user will be prompted to answer questions that help to fill out the README


## Usage

- The use of this command line application is to generate a README for the user after they have answered some question regarding what they would like included.

- When the user enters the application, they are first asked what city or town they would like to see the weather for.
- When a user enters any information into the inputs, they can click submit and see what the weather is for the next few days for this location.
- The user will also have a section on the side that shows them the previous places they had entered and they can click and revisit this.
